# API contract — Care Episode Agent

Base URL: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
All responses are JSON. All timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC.

---

## 1. The episode states

The UI must handle every state.

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PRESCRIPTION_RECEIVED` | Uploaded, not yet read |
| `TESTS_IDENTIFIED` | Tests extracted |
| `LABS_SHORTLISTED` | Nearby labs found |
| `BOOKING_REQUESTED` | Emails sent, awaiting lab reply |
| `AWAITING_REPORT` | Booked, waiting for results |
| `REPORT_RECEIVED` | Report uploaded, not yet read |
| `TRENDS_ANALYZED` | Compared against history |
| `ANOMALY_FOUND` | Something changed meaningfully |
| `CONSULT_REQUESTED` | Follow-up consultation requested |
| `NORMAL` | Nothing of concern |
| `CLOSED` | Episode complete |
| `NEEDS_HUMAN` | Agent could not proceed |

`NEEDS_HUMAN` can occur from any state.

## 2. Endpoints

### `GET /api/patients`
List demo patient profiles for the no-login profile picker.

Response `200`:
```json
{
  "patients": [
    { "patient_id": "demo-patient-01", "name": "Shashank Shekhar", "city": "Kolkata", "scenario": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /api/episodes`
Create an episode by uploading a prescription.

Request: `multipart/form-data`
- `file` — image or PDF
- `patient_id` — string, use `"demo-patient-01"`

Response `201`: a full episode object (section 3), state `PRESCRIPTION_RECEIVED`.

### `GET /api/episodes`
List all episodes for a patient.

Query: `patient_id` — string, optional, defaults to `"demo-patient-01"`.

Response `200`:
```json
{ "episodes": [ { "episode_id": "...", "state": "...", "created_at": "...", "summary_line": "..." } ] }
```

### `GET /api/episodes/{episode_id}`
The main one. Poll this every 3 seconds while the episode is active.

Response `200`: a full episode object (section 3).

### `POST /api/episodes/{episode_id}/report`
Upload a lab report.

Request: `multipart/form-data` with `file`.
Response `202`: episode object, state `REPORT_RECEIVED`.

### `POST /api/episodes/{episode_id}/retry`
Retry after `NEEDS_HUMAN`.

Response `200`: episode object.

### `POST /api/tick`
Internal. Cloud Scheduler only. **Neeraj never calls this.**

## 3. The episode object

This is the single shape the whole UI is built on.

```json

  ],

  "error": null
}
```

### Nullability rules

- `prescription` is null only in `PRESCRIPTION_RECEIVED`
- `labs`, `bookings` are empty arrays until `LABS_SHORTLISTED` / `BOOKING_REQUESTED`
- `report` is null until `REPORT_RECEIVED`
- `analysis` is null until `TRENDS_ANALYZED`
- `consultation` is null unless `consult_needed` is true
- `timeline` is **never** empty and never null
- `error` is null unless state is `NEEDS_HUMAN`

**Rule for Neeraj: code defensively against every one of these being null.** The episode grows over time; early states have mostly nulls.

## 4. Enumerated values

Do not invent others. If you need one, message Shashank.

- `urgency`: `urgent` | `routine`
- `booking.status`: `requested` | `confirmed` | `no_response` | `failed`
- `value.flag`: `low` | `normal` | `high`
- `value.trend`: `rising` | `falling` | `stable` | `first_reading`
- `analysis.severity`: `normal` | `attention` | `urgent`
- `consultation.status`: `requested` | `confirmed` | `declined`
- `timeline.actor`: `patient` | `intake_agent` | `logistics_agent` | `diagnostics_agent` | `scheduler`

---

## 5. Errors

`NEEDS_HUMAN` populates the `error` object:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "PRESCRIPTION_UNREADABLE",
    "message": "The prescription image could not be read clearly.",
    "action_hint": "Try uploading a clearer photo in good light.",
    "retryable": true
  }
}
```

Codes: `PRESCRIPTION_UNREADABLE`, `REPORT_UNREADABLE`, `NO_LABS_FOUND`, `LAB_NO_RESPONSE`, `EXTRACTION_FAILED`, `UNKNOWN_TEST`

HTTP errors use the same shape:
```json
{ "error": { "code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "Episode not found", "retryable": false } }
```

---

## 6. Mock data

Create `frontend/mocks/` with one file per state. Suggested set:

- `01-prescription-received.json` — everything null except `prescription: null`, `state`, `timeline` with one entry
- `02-tests-identified.json` — prescription populated, labs empty
- `03-labs-shortlisted.json` — four labs, one `selected: true`
- `04-booking-requested.json` — bookings array populated, status `requested`
- `05-awaiting-report.json` — same, with days elapsed visible in timeline
- `06-trends-analyzed.json` — the full example from section 3
- `07-normal.json` — analysis present, `severity: normal`, `consult_needed: false`, no consultation
- `08-needs-human.json` — `error` populated with `PRESCRIPTION_UNREADABLE`
- `09-closed.json` — everything populated, state `CLOSED`

Build a mock loader that cycles through these on a timer so you can watch the UI progress without a backend at all. That also becomes a useful fallback if the backend has problems on demo day.

---

## 7. Polling

While state is not `CLOSED`, `NORMAL`, or `NEEDS_HUMAN`, poll `GET /api/episodes/{id}` every 3 seconds. Stop polling in terminal states. No websockets — not worth the hours.

---

## 8. Change log

Any change to this contract gets appended here with a date and a reason. If it is not in this file, it is not in the API.

- `2026-09-01` — initial version, frozen.
- `2026-09-03` — multi-patient demo profiles: `GET /api/patients`, `GET /api/episodes?patient_id=`.
